## The purpose of this website
- Show interesting parts or extensions of school projects.
- Showing personal engineering projects outside of school.
- Document my own learning process of courses/tutorials available online.

## Current position
I am currently studying for my Masters degree [Systems & Control](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-systems-and-control/) at the Technical University of Eindhoven.

## Experience

* Graduated as Mechatronics engineer at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Bachelors) 
* Graduation internship at startup company [HFX Research](https://www.hfx-research.com/en/) whom are specialized in [Switched Reluctance Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_reluctance_motor). I helped them creating a sensorless rotor position data estimator. 

* Internship at [VDL Enabaling Technologies Group](https://www.vdletg.com/nl) for whom I have helped revising PLC software for their test environment. This environment is partly physical and partly simulation eventually used for a high-tech vacuum positioning system.  

## Expertise
* Control theory for mechatronic systems
* Machine learning and its applications within robotics

## Current projects
Graduating

## Future plans
* Building a self-balancing robot and comparing first principles modeling and PID control with more advanced modeling and control techniques to observe improvement compared to complexity.
